> Note:
> This template was originally designed with the intention of allowing work
> to be exported not only as a PDF but also as an HTML page or ASCII document.
> However, the focus has since shifted towards creating a polished PDF, making
> this feature largely redundant. As a result, the export to HTML and ASCII is
> no longer covered in the manual, Makefile, or other documentation, and it is
> no longer tested.
